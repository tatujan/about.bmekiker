The near-ubiquitous availability of wireless connectivity lets users take advantage of a large variety of mobile applications. This connectivity predominantly comes in two flavors: cellular and WiFi, with different cost, performance, and coverage tradeoffs. While both technologies evolved to offer impressive performance, they are fundamentally limited by reliance on infrastructure and limitations to coverage driven by economic factors. While there are commercial efforts at infrastructure-less connectivity, they are not as capable of supporting mobile application traffic and lack smartphone interactions at the hardware level. In this paper, we present a new LoRa-based radio already being integrated into smartphones that is capable of supporting real-time voice transmissions on point-to-point connections. We also present an experimental software-based implementation of a relaying protocol that extends that capability across multiple hops. Our solution has the potential to support mobile applications where cellular and WiFi coverage does not currently reach, thus forming a new, third leg of mobile connectivity.
