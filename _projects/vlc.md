Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a wireless optical communication technique through LEDs. LEDs
flash at different intensities to send data to receiver end. To get and recover the data, receiver must
detect intensity differences at the environment. This differences basically carries the data to receiver.
The modulation technique that we use is intensity modulation. According to this modulation tecnique,
photodiode makes direct detection via MATLAB. Weâ€™ve constructed a truly adaptive system. A system
that easily works with any kind of modulation technique.
