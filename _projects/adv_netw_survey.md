With all the technological advancement in recent years, we now, have interconnected devices all around
us. These devices make up what has come to be known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Included in IoT
are: all types of vehicle-to-vehicle communication, smart watches/bracelets, sensors, traffic lights etc.
Having all sorts of devices that are interconnected creates enormous load on the network. For this very
reason, there are network architectures that are specifically designed for different applications that exploit
different features of network infrastructure. In this paper, we will define and mostly focus on two major
network structures and will simulate the differences between them. Our main goal is to compare these two
structures and quantify compromises between the two. By doing simulations, we are hoping to determine
bottlenecks of both infrastructures.
