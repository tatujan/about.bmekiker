The project Voice Recognition is a set of steps which leads to detection of pitch or fundamental frequency.
The method we have used is Cepstral Method which allows us to determine the most dominant frequency
at the range. The reason we have choosen this method is that Cepstral Method is more reliable than some
other outdated version of voice recognition techniques. By this method, many applications can be made
and its use is in variety. Developed on MATLAB Environment
