Vehicular flow is not always optimal when traffic is dense due to time-of-day, population, vehicular accidents,
and differing speeds between vehicles. Congestion, increased travel time, and increased risks of accidents
due to these variables can be reduced by having vehicles inform other vehicles of upcoming emergency
situations or slow downs where better routes might be an option. As vehicular communication standards
have emerged, transmission power must be limited in order to prevent the limited spectrum from being
over saturated. The range of this communication is typically 400 meters, so multi-hop communications
must be utilized in order for the messaging to reach useful distances. This paper is a survey of papers
concerning multi-hop communication in vehicular ad hoc networks.
